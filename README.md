# ToolsDataSet

This repository contains sample data sets and sample tasks designed for testing metadata assessment tools. These tests and the list of metadata assessment tools come from the work done by the [DLF Asessment Interest Group Metadata Working Group](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io). 

You can find the testing form to record the results of your test at [http://bit.ly/MetadataTest](http://bit.ly/MetadataTest) and a spreadsheet with all gathered tools can be found at [http://bit.ly/MetadataTools](http://bit.ly/MetadataTools).

* [Library of Congress MARC Distributions Services](https://www.loc.gov/cds/products/marcDist.php)
* [Project Gutenberg Offline Catalogs](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs)
