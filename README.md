# ToolsDataSet

This repository contains sample data sets and sample tasks originally designed for testing metadata assessment tools. These tests and the list of metadata assessment tools come from the work done by the [DLF Asessment Interest Group Metadata Working Group](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io). 

The sample data included in this repository originally came from the following sources:
* [Library of Congress MARC Distributions Services](https://www.loc.gov/cds/products/marcDist.php)
* [Project Gutenberg Offline Catalogs](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs)
* [Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI) Digital Collections(from OAI feed) ](http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/)
* [D-Scholarship@Pitt (from OAI feed)](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/)

The tests and lists that these sets of data were originally designed for are currently outdated but if you're interested in seeing them, you can find the testing form at [http://bit.ly/MetadataTest](http://bit.ly/MetadataTest) and a spreadsheet with all gathered tools can be found at [http://bit.ly/MetadataTools](http://bit.ly/MetadataTools).
